# One Call
# I. Analysis
## 1. Research  
### a. Scope
One Call is a mobile application that allows users to make direct emergency calls to the nearest required stations(police station, fire station, hospital) with just one tap on the phone. 


1. objectives
The 'One Call' Application:
 - Users do not have to search through their phone contact list for emergency numbers, hence reducing the time to call for help when needed.
 E.g. If one were to dail 999 for the police station, it will be redirected to the station nearest to your location. This causes a delay in receiving help. 
 - Includes a GPS system that tracks user's location and provide the necessary information about emergency stations nearest to the user.
 

### b. Audit
Review existing work and product
1. Field (market) research

2. competitors / alternatives / replacement

4. relevant technologies 

### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)
Understand product vision and constraints
1. product{project} vision 
To provide quick and accessible help at all times with accurate information

2. risk
-Users abuse the usage of emergency buttons, causing false alarm.
-Information of nearest stations are not updated
-Users' handphone GPS is not responsive

3. Obstacles
	1. external threats 
4. constraints 
	1. Internal limitations 
		2. viable technologies
		2. cost
5. opportunities 
	1. **In spite of** the obstacles we have this project has strength from a), b), c), …. 
	2. Persisting problem

5. users

# II. Synthesis
## 1. Requirements Definition
### a. Context Scenarios
A sample context scenario

The following is the first iteration of a context scenario for a primary persona for a personal digital assistant (PDA) type phone, including both the device and its service. Our persona is Vivien Strong, a real-estate agent in Indianapolis, whose goals are to balance work and home life, close the deal, and make each client feel like he or she is her only client.

Here is Vivien’s context scenario:

1. While getting ready in the morning, Vivien uses her phone to check her e-mail. Because it has a relatively large screen and quick connection time, it’s more convenient than booting up a computer as she rushes to make her daughter, Alice, a sandwich for school.
2. Vivien sees an e-mail from her newest client, Frank, who wants to look at a house this afternoon. The device has his contact info, so she can call him with a simple action right from the e-mail.
3. While on the phone with Frank, Vivien switches to speakerphone so she can view the screen while talking. She looks at her appointments to see when she’s free. When she creates a new appointment, the phone automatically makes it an appointment with Frank, because it knows with whom she is talking. She quickly enters the address of the property into the appointment as she finishes her conversation.
4. After sending Alice to school, Vivien heads into the real-estate office to gather some papers for another appointment. Her phone has already updated her Outlook appointments, so the rest of the office knows where she’ll be in the afternoon.
5. The day goes by quickly, and eventually Vivien is running a bit late. As she heads toward the property she’ll be showing Frank, the phone alerts her that her appointment is in 15 minutes. When she flips open the phone, she sees not only the appointment, but also a list of all documents related to Frank, including e-mails, memos, phone messages, and call logs to Frank’s number. Vivien initiates a call, and the phone automatically connects to Frank because it knows her appointment with him is soon. She lets him know she’ll be there in 20 minutes.
6. Vivien knows the address of the property but is unsure exactly where it is. She pulls over and taps the address she put into the appointment. The phone downloads directions along with a thumbnail map showing her location relative to the destination.
7. Vivien gets to the property on time and starts showing it to Frank. She hears the phone ring from her purse. Normally while she is in an appointment, the phone automatically goes to voicemail, but Alice has a code she can press to get through. The phone knows it’s Alice calling, so it uses a distinctive ringtone.
8. Vivien takes the call. Alice missed the bus and needs to be picked up. Vivien calls her husband to see if he can do it. She gets his voicemail; he must be out of service range. She tells him she’s with a client and asks if he can get Alice. Five minutes later the phone sounds a brief tone. Vivien recognizes it as her husband’s; she sees he’s sent her an instant message: “I’ll get Alice; good luck on the deal!”

Notice how the scenario remains at a fairly high level, without getting too specific about interfaces or technologies. It’s important to create scenarios that are within the realm of technical possibility, but at this stage the details of reality are unimportant. We want to leave the door open for truly novel solutions, and it’s always possible to scale back; we are ultimately trying to describe an optimal, yet still feasible, experience. Also notice how the activities in the scenario tie back to Vivien’s goals and try to eliminate as many tasks as possible.
