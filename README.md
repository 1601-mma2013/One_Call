# One Call
# I. Analysis
## 1. Research  
### a. Scope
One Call is a mobile application that allows users to make direct emergency calls to the nearest required stations(police station, fire station, hospital) with just one tap on the phone. 


1. objectives
The 'One Call' Application:
 - Users do not have to search through their phone contact list for emergency numbers, hence reducing the time to call for help when needed.
 E.g. If one were to dail 999 for the police station, it will be redirected to the station nearest to your location. This causes a delay in receiving help. 
 - Includes a GPS system that tracks user's location and provide the necessary information about emergency stations nearest to the user.
 

### b. Audit
Review existing work and product
1. Field (market) research
-Same concept application designer(chance of better function/layout)

## Competitors

**1. Emergency+**
 
 A smartphone apps that developed by Australia’s Triple Zero Awareness Working Group. This apps:

 - provide the caller with information about when to call Triple Zero.
 - provide the caller with information about who to call in various non-emergency situations.
 - assist the caller to dial the relevant number.
 - display the GPS coordinates of the phone's location that the caller can read out to the emergency operator.

*Pros:

 - Accessible for iOS, Android and Windows devices
 - There are no monthly fees associated with use of the app.

*Cons:

 - Not all of them can do what they claim and could delay emergency assistance
 - Time consuming
 
 
**2. BeeSafe**
  
  BeeSafe contains an incredibly wide set of personal safety features. 

 - It can be used to privately alert friends that you’ve arrived at your destination, send info about your changing GPS location and        even setup fake phone calls to slyly escape uncomfortable dates and similar situations.
 - BeeSafe offers an audible alarm and immediately starts broadcasting video captured by your phone and your GPS location. Information      is continually collected and recorded, and is sharable with police should it prove necessary to do so. 
 - You can activate the alarm manually or you can use the Follow Me Timer mode, which which will automatically send an emergency SOS 	    message if you don't check in before the timer runs out.[It is great for late nights or a little extra safety on your morning run        when you only want to disturb people in an emergency.]

*Pros:

 - Accessible for iOS, Android and Windows devices
 - There are no monthly fees associated with use of the app.
 
*Cons:

 - Requires to resigter an account
 - Complex interface
 - Inaccurate location signal

## Relevant application

**One-Touch-911**

 - The app was designed by researchers at Boston-based MIT. 
 - Each of the four buttons on the app trigger a standard call to nearby dispatchers, and each call is placed with the phone's GPS          location, user details and any pre-entered medical information attached. 
 - If the user doesn't have signal on their network, the app lets them 'roam' onto another network to connect the call. [This is a 
   feature built into most phones already]
 - Calls can also be routed through a Wi-Fi network. 
 - Users can additionally send photos or videos, depending on the emergency dispatcher and the region. 
 - The app can be used in 135 countries, and is compatible with any three-digit emergency number in these regions. 


       

### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)


####Product{project} vision 
* Users able to call the correct contact number right away without wasting time when they are in emergency situation.
* To provide quick and accessible help at all times with accurate information

####Risk
* Users abuse the usage of emergency buttons, causing false alarm.
* Information of nearest stations are not updated
* Users' handphone GPS is not responsive

####Obstacles
* Accuracy of location
* Techincal problems
	
####Constraints 
* Lack of information
* Missed up some location and contact.
* Users ignore the application as if they think emergencies not happen always.
* Users do not think that application is helpful.
	
	
####Opportunities 
* Lessen worst case scenerio (Example : if taking more time to find the right contact number,it might be too late)
- to minimize the time needed to obtain correct contact number
- to improve personal safety [especially emergency happens when you are alone/during midnight]

1. Users

2. potential users - User with cellphone

3. (user’s) behaviors - User have problem to find nearest location and emergency call number when they having emergency.

4. (user’s) attitudes - To reduce the time taken and risk.

5. (user’s) aptitudes - Application (Android/iOS)
	
6. (user’s) motivations - To reduce worse case scenario within the time user find the nearest location and emergency call number.

7. (user’s) environments - Anywhere.As long as that environment can detect with GPS.

8. (user’s) tools - Cellphone or tablet.

9. (user’s) challenges - Unable get accurate location and number of each emergency button.

##**2. Modeling**

###a. Personas
 
       Name       : Michellin
       Gender     : Female
       Age        : 20
       Occupation : Student 
       

1. Goal - Able to minimize the time taken when finding emergency number(hospital,police,fire station) at emergency situation.

2. Behaviour - Panic when something happen.

3. attitudes - She is too reliable to phone.

4. aptitudes - Since she is more rely on phone,so she more familiar with phone application.

5. environments - Everywhere

6. tools  - Gadget (Phone/Tablet)

7. challenges - Futuristic and simple visual design.

### a. Context Scenarios

Michee Lin's context scenario

One Friday night, Michee Lin went for her university club's event and by the event finishes, it was already past midnight. Michee hurriedly gets into her car, ready to leave. While driving, Michee glances at her phone, scrolling through Facebook to keep her awake as it was very late and she has had a long day. Then, Michee comes to a cross junction stops at a red light. When the light turned green, Michee accelerated without paying attention to her surroundings as she was looking at her phone. Suddenly, she felt a collision with a loud bang. Feeling shaken, Michee turned and realized that a car has crashed into the left side of her car. Michee panicked and got down of the car. The other driver, a man, exited his car and started blaming Michee for the car crash. 

Michee felt helpless as she has never experienced an accident before. She quickly dialed his father's number. After telling her father what happened, Michee's father guided her to call the police and make a report. After ending the call, Michelled keyed in '999' and called. After a few beeps, someone picked up. To Michee's surprise, an intercom asked Michee to select a language she wanted. After selecting, Michee was asked to hold while a song played. As someone picked up, Michee explained her problem. And again, she was asked to wait for another few seconds as her call was redirected to the police station nearest to her. 

After all the hassle, Michee finally managed to recieve help from two policemen, made a car accident report and settled everything with the driver.
