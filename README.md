# One Call
# I. Analysis
## 1. Research  
### a. Scope

One Call is a life saving mobile application that allows users to call for help from the nearest emergency stations(police station, hospital, fire station) or their closest friends and families in the shortest time possible.

1. objectives
The 'One Call' Application:
 - Users do not have to search through their phone contact list for emergency numbers, hence reducing the time to call for help when needed. 
 E.g. If one were to dail 999 for the police station, the call first be directed to the headquarters of the required station(police station, hospital, fire station), which will then be redirected again to the station nearest to the users' location. The station will then issue help to the users. This causes a delay in receiving help. 
 - Includes a GPS system that tracks user's location and provide the necessary information about the emergency stations nearest to the user.
 - Allows users to save their close friends' and families' contact numbers to alert them in case of emergencies.

## Competitors

**1. Emergency+**
 
 A smartphone apps that developed by Australia’s Triple Zero Awareness Working Group. This apps:

 - provide the caller with information about when to call Triple Zero.
 - provide the caller with information about who to call in various non-emergency situations.
 - assist the caller to dial the relevant number.
 - display the GPS coordinates of the phone's location that the caller can read out to the emergency operator.

*Pros:

 - Accessible for iOS, Android and Windows devices
 - There are no monthly fees associated with use of the app.

*Cons:

 - Not all of them can do what they claim and could delay emergency assistance
 - Time consuming
 
 
**2. BeeSafe**
  
  BeeSafe contains an incredibly wide set of personal safety features. 

 - It can be used to privately alert friends that you’ve arrived at your destination, send info about your changing GPS location and        even setup fake phone calls to slyly escape uncomfortable dates and similar situations.
 - BeeSafe offers an audible alarm and immediately starts broadcasting video captured by your phone and your GPS location. Information      is continually collected and recorded, and is sharable with police should it prove necessary to do so. 
 - You can activate the alarm manually or you can use the Follow Me Timer mode, which which will automatically send an emergency SOS 	    message if you don't check in before the timer runs out.[It is great for late nights or a little extra safety on your morning run        when you only want to disturb people in an emergency.]

*Pros:

 - Accessible for iOS, Android and Windows devices
 - There are no monthly fees associated with use of the app.
 
*Cons:

 - Requires to resigter an account
 - Complex interface
 - Inaccurate location signal

## Relevant application

**One-Touch-911**

 - The app was designed by researchers at Boston-based MIT. 
 - Each of the four buttons on the app trigger a standard call to nearby dispatchers, and each call is placed with the phone's GPS          location, user details and any pre-entered medical information attached. 
 - If the user doesn't have signal on their network, the app lets them 'roam' onto another network to connect the call. [This is a 
   feature built into most phones already]
 - Calls can also be routed through a Wi-Fi network. 
 - Users can additionally send photos or videos, depending on the emergency dispatcher and the region. 
 - The app can be used in 135 countries, and is compatible with any three-digit emergency number in these regions.

# II. Synthesis
## 1. Requirements Definition
### a. Context Scenarios

Michee Lin's context scenario

Before leaving the house in the morning, Michee was notified on her phone that the One-Call application has been updated. She then taps into the app and was required to key in her identification card number to log in. Then, Michee confirms that her close friends and families' information that she have added remains. After that, Michee heads to Multimedia University.

While driving, Michee comes to a red light and stops. Suddenly, Michee feels a collision into the back of her car. Michee gets down from the car to realize that the car behind has crashed into her car. Michee quickly takes out her phone and taps the One-Call application icon at the lock screen of her phone. She taps the 'police' button in the application. Michee then selects the police station nearest to her current location and calls for help. 

After ending the call, a pop up message in the app asks if Michee wants to contact her close contacts. Michee taps 'yes' to send an alert message to her father, an insurance manager, whose info she has preset earlier in the morning. Michee then takes a photo of the scene of accident and sends the message. 

Lastly, Michee is notified that the time of her police call has been recorded in the history section in the app. Michee then closes the app and by the time she does the police has arrived, ready for help.
